OSIC Kolla Deployment Process
=============================

Overview
---------

Consider the scenario where you have a number of bare metal servers and you want to build your own OpenStack cloud on top of them. The purpose of this repository is to help you achieve that goal and perform the OpenStack installation in a simple and efficient manner. The process consists of three parts:

# [Part 1: Provisioning the server.](https://github.com/osic/ref-impl-kolla/blob/master/documents/1-osic-provisioning.md)
# [Part 2: Generating multinode host inventory and creating docker registry.](https://github.com/osic/ref-impl-kolla/blob/master/documents/2-osic-inventory-docker-registry.md)
# [Part 3: Deploy Openstack Kolla.](https://github.com/osic/ref-impl-kolla/blob/master/documents/3-osic-deploy-kolla.md)
